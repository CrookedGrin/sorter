### How to use
Sorter by default will take your selection and sort them in with ordering option you choose relative to their parent. This means you can have a mixed selection of top level frames, and child elements and the plugin wiill always sort them without throwing errors.

If you want to sort just the children of a series of top level frames, enable the "Sort Children Only" option. This setting will be remembered the next time you launch the plugin.
